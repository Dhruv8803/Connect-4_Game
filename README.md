# Connect-4_Game
This repository is about the project based on the Pygame Application named “Connect-4”. The gist of the Connect – 4 game is to get four coins in a straight line in any direction (top to bottom, left to right, or diagonally) before your opponent does the same.

You have to just run command :
Python run.py                                                                                                                                                  

You will get this window in cmd :
